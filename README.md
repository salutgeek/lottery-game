# lottery-game

A Java lottery-game without a real GUI. (it still has CLI though)

I coded this in a "procedural programming" way and it's quite cheap and dirty.

To run the project, you'll need [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
On MacOS, Gradle can be install with [brew](https://brew.sh/)

To run the project:
```sh
./gradlew -q --console plain run
```
